drip is an open-source menstrual cycle tracking app that functions purely locally on the user's phone - no data gets uploaded anywhere. With drip, we are addressing the 3 problems we've found with so many cycle tracking apps - they are purely pink, they lack transparency in their predictions about fertility, and they are unclear about what happens with users' data. drip is designed with gender inclusiveness in mind, ditching the cliche pink design so many apps has. It also, transparently, implements the sympto-thermal fertility awareness method, a medically proven method to let women find out when they are fertile based on 2 body symptoms. We are a team of 3 women developers and believe that our perspective will make for a better cycle tracking app.
